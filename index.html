      <p id="about"> Hey, my name is Emilija and I am a web developer! I started my 
        journey in the field of programming in March 2020, when I enrolled in an Academy 
        for Web programming. In that Academy, I learned to build responsive
        websites, to optimize and maintain them with the following
        technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap. 
        After finishing that Academy, I took another online course about
        WordPress because I wanted to upgrade my knowledge even
        more. Then I started another Academy for PHP programming
        and learned about PHP, AngularJS, and Smarty PHP. At these
        Academies, I developed a couple of projects independently.
        <br> 
        <br>
        From the moment I started studying this, I found myself
        entirely. It is something that I want to build my career on.
        Best decision ever. Every day I practice and work on my
        projects to improve my skills. The desire for continuous
        learning and improvement guides me through life. I am a
        young, enthusiastic and hardworking person. I want to
        upgrade and learn new things. I take my job seriously and
        respect deadlines. If you hire me, I will give my best to fulfill all
        requirements.
